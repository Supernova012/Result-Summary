## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Links

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

1. Curve-boundaries

```CSS
.Class{
border-radius:25px;
```
2. Transparency in CSS
```CSS
.Class{
color: rgba(200,200,200,0.5);
```


### Continued development

In future I would want to improve the organisation of code which at the time is pretty bad.
